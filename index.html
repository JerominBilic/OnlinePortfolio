      <p>
Born April 13, 1992, I am originally from Venezuela and moved to Canada later on in life so I am fluent in both english and spanish. I went to the university of Calgary where I studied Oil & Gas Engineering. I used to work for an oil and gas service company where I worked in multiple projects regarding downhole equipment for the completions business segment, which led to publishing multiple SPE papers as well as applying for multiple patents which can be found here:

However, currently I am a proffesional full time miniature painter for clients worldwide. Outside of work I enjoy playing many instruments, mountaing biking, climbing and playing board games with friends and family.
